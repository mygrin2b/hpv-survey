    <h1>Information Sheet</h1>
    <p><strong>HONG KONG METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Information for Participants</strong></p>
    <p><strong>November 2025</strong></p>
    <p>Dear Students,</p>
    <p>I am Professor Eddy Lam from the Department of Nursing and Health Sciences at Hong Kong Metropolitan University (HKMU). I am conducting a research project on <em>Acceptability of a Combined Respiratory Influenza-COVID-19 Vaccine Among Nursing Students in Hong Kong</em> and would like to invite nursing students to participate in this research study.</p>
    <h2>Research Study Procedures</h2>
    <p>If you decide to participate in this study, you will fill out a survey about your knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions regarding a hypothetical combined vaccine that protects against both influenza and COVID-19 in a single shot. This survey will take place at Hong Kong Metropolitan University. It will take about 10-15 minutes to complete. Your responses will be anonymous, and you won't be recorded in any way. No personally identifying information will be collected.</p>
    <h2>Potential Risks</h2>
    <p>The risks of participating are minimal. You might feel a bit uncomfortable answering questions about vaccines and vaccination attitudes, but there are no physical risks. If you feel stressed or uneasy at any point, you can choose to stop, and support will be available to help you.</p>
    <h2>Potential Benefits</h2>
    <p>While you may not gain direct benefits from participating, your insights are valuable for understanding attitudes toward emerging vaccines that could protect both healthcare workers and patients from multiple respiratory viruses. Your responses will help inform public health strategies and could lead to better vaccination programs for healthcare workers and the broader community.</p>
    <h2>Participation Details</h2>
    <p>Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. This means that you can choose to withdraw from this study at any time without any penalty or negative consequences. All information that you provide will be strictly confidential and will be used only for research purposes. Only the Principal Investigator and Co-Investigators of this study can access the data for research purposes, and no participant will be identified by name in any report of the research study.</p>
    <p>This study has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee (REC) of The Hong Kong Metropolitan University. REC Reference No.: <strong>HE-SF2025/64</strong>.</p>
